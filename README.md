# RADAR – Remote Autonomous Doctor Assistance Robot

RADAR (Remote Autonomous Doctor Assistance Robot) is a ROS 2–based telepresence robotic system designed to enable remote medical interaction and monitoring in environments where physical presence is limited.

The system allows a remote clinician to manually control a mobile robot, view live video, and monitor patient vital signs in real time.
